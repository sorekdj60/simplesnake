# Snake Game

## Introduction

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic arcade game where you control a snake that moves around the screen and tries to eat food to grow in size. Your goal is to get the highest score possible without running into walls or yourself.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game:** Run the Python script provided to start the game. The game window will appear with a snake and a piece of food.

2. **Controlling the Snake:** You can control the snake using either the arrow keys or the following keys:
   - **Arrow keys:** Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to change the snake's direction.
   - **W, A, S, D keys:** Alternatively, you can use the W (Up), A (Left), S (Down), and D (Right) keys to control the snake's direction.

3. **Eating Food:** The objective of the game is to eat the red food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer, and your score will increase.

4. **Scoring:** Your current score is displayed at the top of the game window as "Score: XXX." Try to achieve the highest score possible.

5. **Level Up:** Every time you reach a score that is a multiple of 5, you will level up. The game's speed will increase, making it more challenging.

6. **Game Over:** The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself. When the game is over, you can restart it by clicking the "Restart" button at the top right corner of the game window.
